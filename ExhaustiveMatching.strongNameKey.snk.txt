This file was generated from the VS Developer Command Prompt with the command:

```
REM cd into the ExhaustiveMatching repo root
sn /k ExhaustiveMatching.strongNameKey.snk
```

* There is no password on the Strong Name Key file (as SNKs are used for identity, and not authentication).
* While Strong Names are unnecessary post-.NET Core, they are still necessary for compatibility with consumers targeting .NET Framework 4.x.
* Strong Naming is configured in `Directory.Build.props`
